#Description: This program simulates a game theory situation specifically a prisonner's dilmma game
#             the point of the game is to test the tit for tat strategy!
#             There are 2 strategies: defect or cooperate 
#             There are 2 players: computer and user
#             The game will be played for 5 rounds

#This function has no inputs. it prints a 2d array in the form of a matrix
#this matrix represents the payoff matrix used in my game simulation
